/**
 * This class implements the [MutableSet] interface with an underlying map and reference-equality
 * instead of object-equality. That means, objects are only considered equal, if they are the *same*
 * object. This logic is primarily implemented by the underlying [IdentityHashMap].
 *
 * The use case of this [MutableSet] is quite simple: In order to avoid loops while traversing in
 * the CPG AST we often need to store [Node] objects in a work-list (usually a set), in order to
 * filter out nodes that were already visited or processed (for example, see
 * [SubgraphWalker.flattenAST]. However, using a normal set triggers object-equality functions, such
 * as [Node.hashCode] or even worse [Node.equals], if the hashcode is the same. This can potentially
 * be very resource-intensive if nodes are very similar but not the *same*, in a work-list however
 * we only want just to avoid to place the exact node twice.
