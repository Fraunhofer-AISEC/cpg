/**
 * This [Pass] is responsible for resolving function pointer calls, i.e., [CallExpression] nodes
 * that contain a reference/pointer to a function and are being "called". This pass is intentionally
 * split from the [CallResolver] because it depends on DFG edges. This split allows the
 * [CallResolver] to be run before any DFG passes, which in turn allow us to also populate DFG
 * passes for inferred functions.
 *
 * This pass is currently only run for the [CXXLanguageFrontend], however, in the future we might
 * extend it to other languages that support some kind of function reference/pointer calling, such
 * as Go.
