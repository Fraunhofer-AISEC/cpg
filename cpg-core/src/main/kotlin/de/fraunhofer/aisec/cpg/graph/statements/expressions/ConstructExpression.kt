    /**
     * This function implements the [HasType.TypeListener] interface. We need to be really careful
     * about type changes in the [ConstructExpression]. The problem is, that usually, a
     * [VariableDeclaration] is registered as a type listener for its initializer, e.g, to infer the
     * type of the variable declaration based on its literal initializer. BUT, if the initializer
     * also implements [HasType.TypeListener], as does [ConstructExpression], the initializer is
     * also registered as a type listener for the declaration. The reason for that is primary
     * stemming from the way the C++ AST works where we need to get information about `Integer
     * i(4)`, in which the `Integer` type is only available to the declaration AST element and `(4)`
     * which is the [ConstructExpression] does not have the type information.
     *
     * Furthermore, there is a second source of type listening events coming from the [CallResolver]
     * , more specifically, if [CallExpression.invokes] is set. In this case, the call target, i.e.,
     * the [ConstructorDeclaration] invokes this function here. We have to differentiate between
     * those two, because in the second case we are not interested in the full
     * [FunctionDeclaration.type] that propagates this change (which is a [FunctionType], but only
     * its [FunctionDeclaration.returnTypes]. This is already handled by
     * [CallExpression.typeChanged], so we can just delegate to that.
     *
     * In fact, we could get rid of this particular implementation altogether, if we would somehow
     * work around the first case in a different way.
