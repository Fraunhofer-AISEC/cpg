/**
 * Some languages allow to either overload operators or to add custom operators to classes (see
 * [HasOperatorOverloading]). In both cases, this special function class denotes that this handles
 * this particular operator call.
 *
 * We need to derive from [MethodDeclaration] because all operators have a base class on which they
 * operate on. Therefore, we need to associate them with an [ObjectType] and/or [RecordDeclaration].
 * There are some very special cases for C++, where we can have a global operator for a particular
 * class. In this case we just pretend like it is a method operator.
