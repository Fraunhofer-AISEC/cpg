/**
 * Represents an assignment of a group of expressions (in the simplest case: one) from the right
 * hand side to the left-hand side.
 *
 * This is intentionally modelled as an expression, since some languages support using the resulting
 * value of an assignment as an expression. For example C++ allows the following:
 * ```cpp
 * int a;
 * int b = (a = 1);
 * ```
 *
 * In this example, the [type] of the [AssignExpression] is an `int`.
 *
 * However, since not all languages support this model, we explicitly introduce the
 * [usedAsExpression]. When this property is set to true (it defaults to false), we model a dataflow
 * from the (first) rhs to the [AssignExpression] itself.
