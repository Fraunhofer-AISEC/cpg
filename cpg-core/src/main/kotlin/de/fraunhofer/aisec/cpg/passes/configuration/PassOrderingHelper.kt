/**
 * The goal of this class is to provide ordered passes when invoking the [order] function.
 * * soft dependencies ([DependsOn] with `softDependency == true`): all passes registered as soft
 *   dependency will be executed before the current pass, if they are registered independently
 * * hard dependencies ([DependsOn] with `softDependency == false (default)`): all passes registered
 *   as hard dependency will be executed before the current pass (hard dependencies will be
 *   registered even if the user did not specifically register them)
 * * first pass [ExecuteFirst]: a pass registered as first pass will be executed in the beginning
 * * last pass [ExecuteLast]: a pass registered as last pass will be executed at the end
 * * late pass [ExecuteLate]: a pass that is executed as late as possible without violating any of
 *   the other constraints
 * * [ExecuteBefore] (with soft and hard dependencies): the pass is to be executed before the other
 *   pass (soft: if the other pass is also configured)
 *
 * This class works by
 * 1. Setup
 *     1. Iterating through the configured passes and registering them (plus all `hard == true`
 *        dependencies) as [PassWithDependencies] containers:
 *         1. [ExecuteFirst] and [ExecuteLast] passes are stored in separate lists to keep the
 *            ordering logic simple.
 *         2. Normal passes are stored in the [workingList]
 *     2. [ExecuteBefore] passes: "`A` execute before `B`" implies that "`B` depends on `A`" -> the
 *        dependency is stored in the [PassWithDependencies.dependenciesRemaining] of "`B`". This
 *        logic is implemented in [populateExecuteBeforeDependencies].
 *     3. [DependsOn] passes: [PassWithDependencies.dependenciesRemaining] keeps track of these
 *        dependencies. [populateNormalDependencies] implements this logic.
 *     4. A [sanityCheck] is performed.
 * 2. Ordering
 *     1. [firstPassesList] passes are moved to the result.
 *     2. While the [workingList] is not empty:
 *         1. All passes ready to be scheduled are moved to the result excluding late passes. If
 *            this found at least one pass, then the loop starts again.
 *         2. Late passes are considered for scheduling as well. If this found at least one pass,
 *            then the loop starts again. Otherwise, the dependencies cannot be satisfied.
 *     3. [lastPassesList] passes are moved to the result.
 *
 * Note: whenever a pass is moved to the result:
 * - it is removed from the [workingList] (and [firstPassesList] / [lastPassesList])
 * - the other pass's [PassWithDependencies.dependenciesRemaining] are updated.
