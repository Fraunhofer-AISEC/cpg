/**
 * Creates new connections between the place where a variable is declared and where it is used.
 *
 * A field access is modeled with a [MemberExpression]. After AST building, its base and member
 * references are set to [Reference] stubs. This pass resolves those references and makes the member
 * point to the appropriate [FieldDeclaration] and the base to the "this" [FieldDeclaration] of the
 * containing class. It is also capable of resolving references to fields that are inherited from a
 * superclass and thus not declared in the actual base class. When base or member declarations are
 * not found in the graph, a new "inferred" [FieldDeclaration] is being created that is then used to
 * collect all usages to the same unknown declaration. [Reference] stubs are removed from the graph
 * after being resolved.
 *
 * Accessing a local variable is modeled directly with a [Reference]. This step of the pass doesn't
 * remove the [Reference] nodes like in the field usage case but rather makes their "refersTo" point
 * to the appropriate [ValueDeclaration].
