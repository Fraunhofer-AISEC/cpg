/**
 * This interface needs to be implemented by [Node]s in the graph, wo serve as an entry-point to
 * resolution, so that we can follow the EOG path from these nodes and resolve all symbols
 * accordingly in the [SymbolResolver].
 *
 * In some cases, the [Node] that implements this interface will add itself, for example in a
 * [FunctionDeclaration], so that we can use all functions as an entry-point to symbol resolution.
 * In other cases, certain child nodes might be added to [resolutionStartNodes], for example to add
 * all top-level declarations in a [TranslationUnitDeclaration].
 *
 * The common denominator is that all the nodes contained in [resolutionStartNodes] **start** an EOG
 * path, i.e,. they should have a valid [Node.nextEOG], but an empty [Node.prevEOG].
