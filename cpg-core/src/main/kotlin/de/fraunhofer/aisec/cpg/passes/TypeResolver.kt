     * This function tries to "resolve" a [Type] back to the original declaration that declared it
     * (see [DeclaresType]). More specifically, it harmonises the type's name to the FQN of the
     * declared type and sets the [Type.declaredFrom] (and [ObjectType.recordDeclaration]) property.
     * It also sets [Type.typeOrigin] to [Type.Origin.RESOLVED] to mark it as resolved.
     *
     * The high-level approach looks like the following:
     * - First, we check if this type refers to a typedef (see [ScopeManager.typedefFor]). If yes,
     *   we need to make sure that the target type is resolved and then resolve the type to the
     *   target type's declaration.
     * - If no typedef is used, [ScopeManager.lookupSymbolByName] is used to look up declarations by
     *   the type's name, starting at its [Type.scope]. Depending on the type, this can be
     *   unqualified or qualified. We filter exclusively for declarations that implement
     *   [DeclaresType].
     * - If this yields no declaration, we try to infer a record declaration using
     *   [tryRecordInference].
     * - Finally, we set the type's name to the resolved type, set [Type.declaredFrom],
     *   [ObjectType.recordDeclaration], sync [Type.superTypes] with the declaration and set
     *   [Type.typeOrigin] to [Type.Origin.RESOLVED].
