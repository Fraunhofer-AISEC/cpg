/**
 * The value evaluator tries to evaluate the (constant) value of an [Expression] basically by
 * following DFG edges until we reach a [Literal]. It also evaluates simple binary operations, such
 * as arithmetic operations, as well as simple string concatenations.
 *
 * The result can be retrieved in two ways:
 * * The result of the [resolve] function is a JVM object which represents the constant value
 * * Furthermore, after the execution of [evaluate], the latest evaluation path can be retrieved in
 * the [path] property of the evaluator.
 *
 * It contains some advanced mechanics such as resolution of values of arrays, if they contain
 * literal values. Furthermore, its behaviour can be adjusted by implementing the [cannotEvaluate]
 * function, which is called when the default behaviour would not be able to resolve the value. This
 * way, language specific features such as string formatting can be modelled.
