/**
 * This class uses a [DFA] to evaluate if the order of statements in the CPG is correct. It needs
 * the following inputs:
 * - [consideredBases]: A set of the IDs of nodes (typically the [VariableDeclaration]) which are
 * considered.
 * - [nodeToRelevantMethod]: A mapping between CPG nodes and their operators used by the respective
 * edges in the DFA. Currently, we only consider [CallExpression]s. If a node is not contained in
 * this list, it is not considered by the evaluation as we assume that the method is not relevant.
 * - [thisPositionOfNode]: If a non-object oriented language was used, this is a map from CPG nodes
 * (i.e., the [CallExpression]) to the argument position serving as base of the operation.
 *
 * To improve the results, it is useful to run [de.fraunhofer.aisec.cpg.passes.UnreachableEOGPass]
 * prior to running the analysis and set the flag [eliminateUnreachableCode] to `true`. This removes
 * results which may occur in unreachable code.
