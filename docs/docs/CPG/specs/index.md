# Specifications
The core of the code property graph are its nodes and edges. Here, you find the
links to the specifications of the following concepts:

* Explore our [Graph Model](./graph)
* [Data Flow Graph (DFG)](./dfg)
* [Data Flow Graph (DFG) Function Summaries](./dfg-function-summaries.md)
* [Evaluation Order Graph (EOG)](./eog)
* [Program Dependence Graph (DFG)](./pdg)
* [Our inference rules](./inference) which may modify the graph
* Read about [our overlay graph](./overlays) if you want to encode more information
