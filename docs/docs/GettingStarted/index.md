# Getting Started

The CPG can be used in different ways:

* [As a library for Kotlin/Java](./library)
* [With custom automated analyses using the Query API](./query)
* [Via neo4j](./neo4j)


In the first three cases, the [Shortcuts](./shortcuts) provide you a convenient way to
quickly explore some of the most relevant information.
